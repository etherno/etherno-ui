# Etherno UI

React UI library for rapid development. Internally it's using styled-components with styled-system and react-spring.

## Considerations

Etherno UI depends on normalize.css, system-fonts stack and custom styles for global styling.

Take a look in the `gallery` folder to see how this is handled.

## Development

Run the following commands in the root folder:
```
npm run install
npm run start
```

Then go to the gallery folder and run the same commands in a new tab:
```
npm run install
npm run start
```

A server will be up and running at `localhost:3000`.
